**Portfolio**<br/>
Portolio with a responsive layout.

**Description**<br/>
This portfolio was modified and updated from the previous. In this update, I have included buttons and links to social contacts, and professional contacts. Created links that will direct to my projects, and other works that I have accomplished. Using bootstrap 4.5 helped in the design and layout of the site.<br/>
